Cosmic Crew Visual Style Guide & Show Details (Panoramic Focus)

1. General Show Style
Format & Aspect Ratio: Always 16:9 HD (1920×1080) panoramic – prioritize wide establishing shots that encompass full environment scale.
2D Cartoon Style: Bold, uniform black outlines; rounded, friendly silhouettes; minimal perspective (slight 3/4 angle) ensuring clarity across wide scenes.

Panoramic Composition:
Use negative space to frame action: characters should have breathing room on either side.
Align horizon or key architecture at the lower third of the frame for dynamic wide vistas.
For group shots, arc characters along a gentle curve to use full width.
Animation Quality: Smooth ease-in/out, subtle squash-and-stretch on limbs, dynamic camera moves (wide pans, push-ins, nebula swipes).
Tone & Inspiration: "Spidey & Friends" meets "Hilda" in outer space – energetic, playful, modern.
Audio Elements: Upbeat orchestral-pop score, electronic whooshes and sparkles, VO snippets, culminating in a thrilling "BLASTOFF!" sting.

2. Visual Style Guide
A. Line & Shape
Outlines: Consistent black strokes (3–5px at HD).
Silhouettes: Heads ~1/4 height, bodies centered in frame; maintain clear separation against wide backgrounds.

B. Color Palette & Textures
Background Gradients: Deep navy (#0A214B) to indigo (#2B1A55) swirls.
Neon Accents: Aqua (#0EF2D4), chartreuse (#CEF64D), amber (#FFD55A).
Flat Fills + Light Gradients: Use 5–10% opacity gradients to add dimension without reducing readability across wide shots.
Surface Textures: Simplified patterns on bark, moss, and metal – ensure consistency when spread across broad canvases.

C. Lighting & Effects
Glow: 10–15px outer glow on neon elements (constellations, lanterns, screens).
Rim Light: Accent color rim lighting to separate characters from panoramic backgrounds.
Particles: Star and diamond sprites (2–8px) scattered in layers to add depth.

D. Character Expressions & Poses
Expressions: Large pupils, bright highlights – readable even at small sizes in wide frames.

Poses: One clear action per character; maintain strong silhouettes against wide environments.

3. Intro Sequence (Wide Cuts)
Intro Sequence (Wide Cuts)
0–6s: Universe & Title – Galaxy swirls fill frame, Nova Nook orb in lower third, title overlays center.
6–12s: Alex @ Astro Treehouse – Push-in on wide pod interior, showing both window views.
12–18s: Leo @ Cosmic Garage – Wide pan across hangar then focus on his loop.
18–24s: Izzy & El @ Orbit Egg – Split-screen day/night pods in one frame.
24–30s: Val @ Nova Nook – Wide bubble interior then zoom on morphing backpack.
30–36s: Finn @ Starship Nest – Wide asteroid platform, sliding walkway unfolds.
36–42s: Dee @ Cosmic Garage – Wide console bay then push-in on bug zap.
42–48s: Evie @ Nova Nook – Full star-map reveal, ripple across ceiling.
48–54s: Nico & Sami Split-Screen – Two wide environments side by side.
54–57s: Rayna @ Orbit Egg – Wide pod interior before journal recursion.
57–60s: Final Group @ Nova Nook – Arc of characters across full width, logo burst center.

Use nebula wipes, rocket-trail reveals, and bubble-phase transitions to shift between wide frames.

Watch Integration (Leo’s RM 52-05)
Pan Shot: Show watch on Leo’s wrist in a mid-shot; tourbillon rotating in foreground.

Textures & Colors: Carbon-TPT black with red screws (#D72E2E), gold bridges (#E8B558), soft blue crystal glare.

To keep every watch-shot consistent, add these notes to your visual style guide:
Case Shape:
Tonneau “barrel” silhouette with gently curved sides, about 1/5 the height of Leo’s forearm.

Dial Details:
Exposed tourbillon cage at 7 o’clock, star-shaped upper bridge (echoing your star motifs), bold red screws and black PVD accents.

Materials & Texture:
Black carbon-TPT case texture (fine horizontal striations), brushed titanium crown, skeletonized movement.

Color Palette Call-outs:
