Clip 1: Universe & Title (0 – 6 s)
Visual: Wide panorama of a glittering galaxy—swirling purples and indigos—stars twinkling in the distance. A friendly planet drifts into view at the bottom.
Animation: Slow zoom in on a glowing orb clubhouse (Nova Nook) that pulses once. Star-speckled light trails spiral toward it.
Audio: Ethereal whoosh + soft orchestral swell, then playful sparkle sound on pulse.
VO (child, upbeat): “In a universe full of mystery…”
Text: Fade-in large rounded type “Code Crew Cosmic,” hold 2 s, then fade.

Clip 2: Alex at Astro Treehouse (6 – 12 s)
Environment: Command pod carved into a cosmic tree—purple bark with neon-aqua veins, glowing green-yellow leaf clusters overhead, two round glass windows revealing an indigo nebula.
Animation: Quick push-in to Alex sketching a constellation map on a neon-aqua tablet. Each star-point lights up in sequence (“tick-tick” sync to beats). Subtle squash-and-stretch as Alex taps the stylus.
Audio: Light “tick-tick” on each point, gentle chime on final connection. VO: “Meet Alex, master of the plan!”
Text: Lower third “Alex – Algorithms.”

Clip 3: Leo in Cosmic Garage (12 – 18 s)
Environment: Asteroid cave workshop—warm sienna stone walls, throbbing neon-aqua ramp, robotic arms overhead, control console glowing cyan.
Animation: Leo taps his beat-watch; floor panels light up to his drumbeat. He dances a short loop, motion trails emphasizing each move. Camera pans left to right following his steps.
Audio: Driving drum loop, whoosh on camera pan. VO: “Here’s Leo—looping to perfection!”
Text: “Leo – Loops.”

Clip 4: Izzy & El in Orbit Egg (18 – 24 s)
Environment: Sleek white-aqua pod drifting over a stylized planet. One half shows daytime, the other nighttime.
Animation: Izzy steps in on sunlit side, taps a “sun” icon—her goggles glow gold, panel lights flash.
El slides in on dark side, flips an “else” lever—shadows retreat, stars and lanterns inside pod light up.
Audio: Two-tone “ding-dong,” celestial sparkles on lever flip. VO: “Izzy and El—if…then…always!”
Text: “Izzy & El – Conditionals.”
--------------------------
Clip 5: Val in Nova Nook (24 – 30 s)
Environment: Inside the space-time bubble—curved walls alive with constellation maps, plush indigo rug, hanging star lanterns.
Animation: Val opens her backpack; it morphs three times (telescope → snacks → toolkit), each pop paired with a burst of star particles. Slight bounce on each morph.
Audio: Three quick “pop-pop-pop” effects, rising synth flourish. VO: “Val—variables for any adventure!”

Text: “Val – Variables.”
--------------------------
Clip 6: Finn at Starship Nest (30 – 36 s)
Environment: Crescent-moon ship on an asteroid garden—lavender hull, neon-aqua trim, emerald moss, geode crystals.
Animation: Finn steps out, presses “Fn()” on his chest. Gears animate in sequence around the hull, opening a hatch and deploying a glowing walkway.
Audio: Mechanical “clunk-whirr,” echoing electronic tone on hatch. VO: “Finn—ready to run any routine!”
Text: “Finn – Functions.”
--------------------------
Clip 7: Dee in Cosmic Garage (36 – 42 s)
Environment: Back to the asteroid workshop—this time at a console alcove, warm amber lamp light.
Animation: Dee kneels, peers through her magnifier at a flickering bug swarm on the screen. Each bug vanishes with a “zap” sparkle. Camera pushes in on magnifier lens.
Audio: Soft “beep-zap” per bug, low “hmmm” detective hum. VO: “Dee—debugging every glitch!”
Text: “Dee – Debugging.”
--------------------------
Clip 8: Evie in Nova Nook (42 – 48 s)
Environment: Bubble interior, constellation map fully lit, lanterns swinging gently.
Animation: Evie taps her star wand at a central constellation node—it ripples outward, animating all map lines in a wave. Camera tilts up to follow the ripple.

Text: “Evie – Events.”
--------------------------
Clip 9: Nico & Sami Split Screen (48 – 54 s)
Environment Left (Nico): Starship Nest garden bed.
Animation Left: Nico waters each cosmic plant in a timed loop; stopwatch ticks match water drops, each flower blooms on zero.
Audio Left: Ticking countdown + bloom “ding.” VO: “Nico—never stops till it’s done!”
Text Left: “Nico – Conditional Loops.”

Environment Right (Sami): Lower Astro Treehouse pod, shelves of floating star blocks.
Animation Right: Sami sweeps sorting mat across blocks; they snap into neat rows with “click-click.”
Audio Right: Crisp “click-click” + soft chime. VO: “Sami—sorting secrets in a snap!”
Text Right: “Sami – Sorting & Searching.”

(Screen splits seamlessly at 50 s, then recombines at 54 s.)

Clip 10: Rayna & Finale in Orbit Egg → Nova Nook (54 – 60 s)
Environment Start: Orbit Egg above the planet.
Animation Rayna (54 – 57 s): Rayna opens her spiral journal; each page folds inward recursively, glowing softly; camera zooms into smallest page.
Audio: Dreamy “whoosh-echo.” VO: “Rayna—stories within stories!”

Audio: Full theme chorus swell + “BLASTOFF!” musical sting.
